          <h3> Digital Eye </h3>
          <p> It's a deep learning model for digitizing handwritten documents, English and Arabic. The model was trained on Thousands of handwritten documents. In‐house team of annotators helped to annotate and label the data for supervised learning.The model scored 0.15 CER on English and 0.22 CER on Arabic and it outperformed Google OCR performance on handwritten documents. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3> Covid-19 Detection </h3>
          <p>State of the art deep learning model for detecing COVID-19 from COUGHVID cough audio files. The project achieved 0.98 AUC for audio samples with COVID-19 positive samples. It was open-sourced and published on Interspeech Conference 2021.</p>
